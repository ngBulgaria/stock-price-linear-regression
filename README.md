# stock-price-linear-regression
I started learning Python two days ago and I got amazed how easy you can solve problems with so short code. I just wrote a script and I decided to share it.

This is a short Python script that pulls stock prices from Yahoo Finance and plots a chart with linear regression for a specified period of time. This can help traders identify trending stocks.
